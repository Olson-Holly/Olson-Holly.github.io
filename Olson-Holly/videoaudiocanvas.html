  <h2>HTML5 video</h2>
  <p>This video is about the girls basketball coach from my home town Dietrich, ID.  He is a great guy and the older brother of one of my
    classmates.  Acey was even one of my sunday school teachers at church.  He has a great family and is a good guy.  You might not want to
    watch this video but I like it.</p>
